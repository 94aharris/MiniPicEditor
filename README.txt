Description:
     When performing photo resizing (before uploading a photo to a website or embedding it in content) it can be something which is difficult to do quickly. Photoshop, GIMP, etc. are great tools but take a while to get going and photos typically have to be resized one at a time. Several websites offer photo resizing, but this requires uploading your photo to someone else, waiting for the action to be performed, dowloading the image, and hoping that your photo does not exceed the max allowed size. MiniPicEditor is a java project started to help a friend with their daily work, is scoped narrowly towards the most common and quick functions performed on photos for social promotions. At this time, the primary purpose of the editor will be to resize a photo or multiple photos and save them in a reletively quick and easy manner. Additional functions may be added as requested.
